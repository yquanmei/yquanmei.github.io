                  <p>12月20日，王力宏婚变事件让「煤气灯操纵(gaslighting)」这个词进入公众视野。<br>
该书教你快速识别精神操控，远离“毒性关系”。</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Psychologists use the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; to refer to a specific type of manipulation where the manipulator is trying to get someone else to question their own reality, memory or perceptions.<br>
The term 'gaslighting' actually comes from a 1938 play, Gas Light (which was turned into a more widely known movie in 1944, Gaslight), where a husband manipulates his wife to make her think she's actually losing her sense of reality so he can commit her to a mental institution and steal her inheritance.<br>
US-based author of The Gaslight Effect, Dr Robin Stern, outlined the insidious nature of gaslighting, writing: 'It's a form of emotional abuse and manipulation that is difficult to recognise and even harder to break free from.'<br>
The term describes a type of emotional abuse, and unlike other forms, is difficult to recognise because it distorts a person's sense of reality.<br>
At its mildest, gaslighting leaves women uneasy, wondering why they always seem to end up in the wrong.<br>
At it's worst, gaslighting leads to major depression, with formerly strong, vibrant women reduced to abject misery and self-hatred.<br>
vigilant as you must be if any of the following features occurred in your relationship</p>
<ul>
<li>Ghosting<br>
It can happen when you've met up a few times, or even after things get serious - but constitutes when someone literally removes you from their life, without warning.</li>
<li>Slow Fade<br>
This is where someone gradually backs away from a potential relationship, but doesn't cut all ties immediately.</li>
<li>Breadcrumbing<br>
This is when someone leaves a trail of small but flirtatious messages for a potential date, with no intention of meeting.<br>
Taking its name from the classic tale of Hansel and Gretel, breadcrumbing involves leading someone on with a trail of flirtatious messages but never following through.</li>
<li>Benching<br>
Before couples have 'the talk' and define their relationship - also known by the acronym 'DTR' - either party is at risk of being 'benched'.<br>
This happens when one person is unsure of their future with their current partner and so puts them on the 'bench' - as with sports team reserves - and looks at other options. If nothing better comes along, they might come back into play.</li>
<li>Zombie-ing<br>
This is when someone has already ghosted his or her way out of a relationship - but then tries to come back.<br>
Social media has also opened up a new playing field for zombies, who can now 'like', 'comment' or 'follow' their way back onto their target's radar.</li>
<li>Layby<br>
'Layby' refers to someone who is in a relationship but looking to get out. Instead of risking a period of singleness when it eventually ends, a layby starts laying the groundwork with other women or men who they might want to date next.<br>
Those being pursued by a layby should be wary as he or she might well have a number of 'next' options lined up - not to mention the fact that they are not technically single.</li>
<li>Catch and release<br>
On the other end of the spectrum is the dater who practises the 'catch and release'.<br>
This is a move favoured by those who enjoys the 'chase' part of a relationship, the first flirtations before any commitments are made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Afterall, healthy relationships are based on respect and equality.</p>
